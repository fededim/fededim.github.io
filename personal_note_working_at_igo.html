<h2 id="personalnote">Personal advice while applying for working at international organizations</h2>

<p>During life you may be applying for vacancies at international government organizations (European community, United Nations, NATO, etc.) and I would like to point out some hints for not having potential unpredictable issues jeopardizing your career and even your life as it happened to my person.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you are thinking of working in such vacancies you are for sure a well above average person or even a top performer among your peers who has been successful in studies (or languages) and who wants to put your skills at the service of a greater cause obtaining at the same a high rewarding job. You are also probably a person who likes competition because you want to prove yourself how you rank among your international peers. Unluckily people who are above average in studies (and I put myself among these) are somewhat naive: they spend their time studying or working hard, often helping others without requiring anything back, but at the same without thinking that envy is omnipresent and, remember, <b>envy creates silent enemies, sometimes even deadly</b>. <b><i>Yes, deadly, e.g. persons who suffer from the success of others and want at all cost to curb or even destroy it because according to their brain they are better than you (maybe just for the physical appearance) and they have to prove it to others.</i></b></p>
<p>Many years ago I started applying for vacancies at European Commission and I was even summoned for interviews a few times (I am including <a href="./Images/Old epso applications.jpg">a screenshot from the EPSO website</a> - the European personnel selection office) and I inadvertently talked about these interviews to my "friends" and my former university alumni without boasting and above all without thinking of someone could be plotting against me and my career.</p>
<p>In particular after some time I applied to one vacancy as a software engineer which required a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance">security clearance</a>, an unknown word to me at that time and even still "blurry" today which fundamentally "warranted" the fact that the candidate was "somewhat trustable" in giving him the access to classified information. It is obviously an undocumented procedure to most of people; as far as I was able to gather reading some newspaper articles a security clearance involves a background check (criminal records at least but probably also other checks) from the national secret service about you, your parents, your close relatives and friends. Should something be found not to be "right", the clearance procedure would have ended just by "labelling" the person "not suitable" without any "consequence" on him or his family (as a sad note of my family in '80s my father had a car accident in which a person died and he was sentenced to misdemeanour involuntary vehicular manslaughter).</p>
<p>I was on a holiday in US when I received a summon for the interview and just a week before my interview I was introduced by <b>Fabrizio Rizza</b>, a Calabrese former university alumni, friend at that time, to two of his friends, <b>Marco Marocchi</b> and <b>Sebastiano Ceraudo</b>, which revealed to be easy-going and sociable at the beginning and even introduced me some women external to my circle of friends, but revealed then very "felonious" after some time. As a side note this Calabrese was introduced to me by another former university alumni <b>Paolo Dellepiane</b>, who in turn was introduced to me by a former my same high-school student <b>Luigi Chirico</b>, who started studying computer science at the university like us, but then left to become a policeman. Paolo Dellepiane at high-school while attending the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liceo_classico">classical liceum</a> he studied also musical instruments at conservatory.</p>
<p>At the same time, <b>Stefania Serra</b>, a female friend of a former close friend of family <b>Roberto Bazzoni</b> introduced me two new women, <b>Chiara Parodi</b> e <b>Paola Mazzarello</b>, which revealed troublesome after some time too and one of them later even married one of friends of Rizza. To make a long story short all the situation degenerated after a holiday to Canary Island - Gran Canaria organized by Mr. Marocchi with Mr. Ceraudo, his girlfriend <b>Susanna Giardina</b>, her cousin <b>Maria De Pippo</b> from Turin and her boyfriend <b>Marco Francavilla</b>. Nothing particular happened as far as I can remember on that holiday except that one night I got drunk after being offered some drinks and <b>Maria De Pippo</b> kept asking sneakily repeatedly if I could be a non-heterosexual, making me wonder if her husband maybe practised triolism or was a non-heterosexual looking for fun. Anyway, even after cutting all them off after that holiday (I still have the doubt whether they went again to Canary Island by themselves later), I experienced troubles not only with the Calabrese Rizza and his other friends, but also with my historical circle of friends without being given any reason. At that time I was employed at Altran Italia, a multinational French consulting company, I was hired by the director <b>Giorgo Dabbene from Turin</b>, initially in Milan HQ under the "pleasure" of the manager <b>Alessandro Zamboni</b> and the functional analyst <b>Mariafrancesca Iolo</b>, then I requested to be moved back to Genova, under the "pleasure" of the manager <b>Emanuele Castagno</b> working as a consultant at Ericsson after some time in the local branch; <b>one brother of Mr. Rizza had been working there for years</b> and I experienced some serious troubles also there, which forced me to resign. As a sad fact the secretary of Genova branch of Altran <b>Valeria Bruzzone</b>, who studied as psychologist, with whom I and other co-workers used to have lunch died mysteriously at her home in her early thirties, only two weeks after I went to a solo aperitif with her (at that time she had recently broken up with her historical boyfriend, moreover at the aperitif in an another table there was also <b>Lorena Piloro</b> a former girlfriend of my family friend Roberto Bazzoni, for all the weird or odd things that happened to me I even suspected that I had been investigated as a suspect for her strange death). To try to understand what happened I had to hire some private detectives (ex-policeman) and I found some "worrying" facts, the most important of which are:
<ul>
<li>Mr. Ceraudo had a criminal record and he has origins from a Calabrese town called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petilia_Policastro">Petilia Policastro</a> where this surname is <a href="https://milano-corriere-it.translate.goog/milano/notizie/cronaca/11_febbraio_22/sfratto-ndrangheta-19070587864.shtml?_x_tr_sl=it&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=it&_x_tr_pto=wapp">notorious for being a 'Ndrangheta clan</a>: the referenced article is published on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corriere_della_Sera">"Il corriere della Sera"</a>, the most read newspaper in Italy and talks about a series of <b>surnames like the Coscos, the Carvellis, the Comberiatis, the Toscanos and the Ceraudos who were all originating from Petilia Policastro and involved in criminal activities of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Ndrangheta">'Ndrangheta</a></b>. Moreover Mr. Ceraudo has a cousin in Turin called <b>Carvelli</b>. Honestly, I would like to have known all these facts before going to such holiday, because I was applying for positions at international organizations and I would have avoided at all cost of staying in a hotel room with anyone with criminal records (I do not know if he is non heterosexual, as far as I can remember and I know I was not harassed at all, but obviously to defend his friends Rizza and Marocchi he could have done anything to me or my family). Probably the former Calabrese university alumni Rizza who introduced him to me knew something about these facts and did it on purpose. Rizza has two brothers, one working in Ericsson at my hometown Genova and another working in Zurich, Switzerland.</li>
<li><u>Mr. Marocchi had such a vivid interest in understanding if I was a non-heterosexual with his future brother-in-law Francavilla up to the point of staging it (for all the countless times he insisted on this matter I even felt that he wanted to rape me or to be raped by someone else) </u>: moreover, his wife to-be managed a dance school in Turin. If you Google for their surnames it comes out some unwelcomed articles:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www-lastampa-it.translate.goog/torino/2017/07/20/news/strage-di-caselle-la-cassazione-conferma-l-ergastolo-per-palmieri-e-la-domestica-de-pippo-1.34454212/?_x_tr_sl=it&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=it&_x_tr_pto=wapp">An article from the local mostly read Turin newspaper La Stampa</a> about a woman surnamed De Pippo who was involved in the massacre of Caselle (a town nearby Turin)</li>
<li><a href="https://www-lagazzettadelmezzogiorno-it.translate.goog/news/foggia/1625966/foggia-i-pentiti-villani-e-francavilla-raccontano-tutti-gli-affari-dei-clan-della-societa.html?_x_tr_sl=it&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=it&_x_tr_pto=wapp">An article from the local Apulia newspaper</a> about a local clan named <b>"Sinisi-Francavilla"</b> active in the city of Foggia</li>
<li>Turin has always been historically a city with a lot of "calabrese activities": the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Saviano">Roberto Saviano, author of Gomorra's book</a>, entitled <a href="https://www-quotidianopiemontese-it.translate.goog/2016/06/16/saviano-torino-e-la-citta-piu-a-sud-ditalia-che-la-ndrangheta-considera-sua-territorio/?_x_tr_sl=it&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=it&_x_tr_pto=wapp">Turin as the largest city in "Calabria"</a>. As matter of fact, in 2023 <a href="https://torino-repubblica-it.translate.goog/cronaca/2023/07/19/news/le_mani_della_ndrangheta_sul_bar_del_tribunale_di_torino_4_arresti-408276991/?_x_tr_sl=it&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=it&_x_tr_pto=wapp">the cooperative managing the bar of the courthouse of Turin was closed due to 'Ndrangheta involvement</a>.
<li>Marco Francavilla plays <a href="https://kultunderground.org/art/17716/">with an italian rock band called <b>Progetto Luna</b> (in English "Aiming at the Moon")</a>: coincidentally Luna (which in Italian means "moon") is also the second name of my first girlfriend which I happened to discover to be died very young in her early thirties. Moreover, they seem to have composed the soundtrack of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOVM-VXsC_u9Q6jRQQ2oOHA/about">non-heterosexual online fiction called G&T (by Francesco D'Alessio e Matteo Rocchi)</a>. Their band also released at that time an <a href="https://soundcloud.com/progettoluna/sets/progetto-luna-ogni-tanto-sento">album called strangely "Ogni tanto sento le voci" (in English "Every now and then I hear voices")</a></li> 
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mr. Marocchi tried extensively to make me date of his female friend called <b>Claudia Rovani</b>, a surname originating from <b>Argentina</b> and <b>Brasil</b>. Mr. Rizza once warned me against her (he literally said "there's something about her that I just don't like I really don't like"), I can remember she was very very thin and she studied as a psychologist in Florence. At the time I was introduced to her, she dated officially <b>Fabio Risso</b>, who managed a bar in my home town called "A Due Passi Dal Mare" with an Albanese business partner (I do not remember his name), and she was a close friend of <b>Stefano Toscanini</b>. I can't say anything against her, at least for what I know and the times I met her (I mean to defend her close friend Marocchi she could even have made up or staged any slander about me or my family). As a curios fact Mr. Marocchi suggested a few times sneakily to go on holiday in Argentina during our Italian summer vacation, to which I replied funnily without thinking badly at that time that it was winter there, so it was cold and I didn't feel like go skiing. As a matter of fact, my family has some relatives in Argentina, but I have only seen a few of them once in my whole life, though we have been recently keeping the contact on the phone every now and then.</li>
<li>Mr. Marocchi's best friend is called <b>Federico Escobar</b>, quite a "worrying" surname, he had <b>Chilean</b> origins and relatives from Campania, he lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapallo">Rapallo</a>, the same town where my brother and his wife were living at the time of the facts, even though I can't say anything against him, at least for what I know and the few times I met him (same note as Rovani's apply). He had an affair with <b>Claudia Bonifazio</b>, a woman related to Sebastiano Ceraudo's first wife. He had just left London where he was working as a cook when he was introduced to me and used to dance salsa and bachata like me, though I met him only twice in the dancefloors of my city.</li>
<li>My former close friend of family <b>Roberto Bazzoni</b> just a month after my first interview in international organizations tried to kiss me out of blue in the middle of party and made us take an artistic snapshot of the scene by a female photographer friend of him <b>Stefania Serra</b>, probably accomplice of him minimising it was a joke (by the way Mr.Bazzoni works as an expropriator consultant for the courthouse and moreover he even dated female judges, ironically I can't think of a better "alibi" for a suspected non-heterosexual).</li>

<li>Mr. Bazzoni and Mr. Rizza had a common friend originating from Campania, called <b>Antimo Verde</b>.</li>
<li>The wife of my brother (so my sister-in-law) <b>Roberta Grillo</b> is a close friend of Mr.Bazzoni and he was the one who actually introduced her to him.</li>
<li>Many of my historical circles of friends had relatives from Calabria and Campania and in particular my former best friend <b>Marco Landa</b> had relatives both from Calabria and Foggia and had a sister who used to play soccer; he has worked for many years abroad on cruise ships for Carnival Cruise Line as a machine officer. For sure some of my former friends were rumoured to be non-heterosexual (my former best friend's brother <b>Paolo Landa</b> was one of these, by the way like Luigi Chirico he started studying computer science at my university, but he then left after a year for studying economy), but obviously I never asked or cared (I am heterosexual, obviously I began to care when I was slandered as one of them and suffered an undeserved damage as a consequence) and I was never informed too. I discovered that a common "friend", <b>Adelmo Bucci</b>, who became a general practitioner has worked with some unprincipled non-heterosexual doctors, whom in the past have been rumoured to have exercised conversion therapies into non-heterosexuals. <u>Moreover there were common female doctor friends between Stefania Serra and Adelmo Bucci who dated some policemen I did not know</u>; they were supposed to be friends of the brother of <b>Marco Pallavicino</b>, another policeman working in Turin. There was also a common friend between Marocchi and Ceraudo and the historical circle of my friends, a woman called <b>Valentina Firpo</b>, friend also of one my best childhood friends <b>Alessandro Rabbia</b> who in turn is also the cousin of Marco Pallavicino. Sometime after these events, a woman posted a picture on her Facebook wall a picture of a group of youngsters where two of them seemed to be <b>Marco Pallavicino</b> and <b>Marco Francavilla</b>, yet no one I knew confirmed or denied this; any as a matter-of-fact Marco Pallavicino studied at university in Turin for some years.</li>
<li>Another manager of the Genova branch of Altran <b>Matteo Gandetto</b> was a friend of <b>Marco Pallavicino</b> (they were born and have lived for several years in Gavi, a town 60 kms from Genova <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortese_di_Gavi">known for its white wine</a>). <b>Matteo Monteverde</b> was another close friend of Marco Pallavicino who studied with him in Turin, he had a seaside house in <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celle_Ligure">Celle Ligure</a> where I went a few times for some parties during which there were also some of their friends from Turin which however I can barely remember and I do not know if they know also Marco Francavilla or his fiancee or some of their friends.</li>
<li>Between my former best friend Marco Landa and Sebastiano Ceraudo/Marco Marocchi there was a common acquaintance called <b>Claudio nicknamed "Pacio"</b> (or maybe it is his surname I do not know I saw him very few times), my former best friend and he worked at that time in the same company, at Wärtsilä in Genoa.</li>
<li>Seven months after the Canary Island "holiday" I went with my parents to my father's second home in Abruzzi (I hadn't been there for ten years) a childhood friend of mine <b>Federico Di Fonso</b> from <b>Pescara</b> after going back home made a funny post on Facebook on another childhood friend <b>Fabio Veno</b> from Naples that there was a bender at our table made up by me, the same Fabio Veno and <b>Marco Ferretti</b> with his sister again from <b>Naples</b> (these last two were more acquaintances for me than friends and they were more connected to Fabio Veno). The next day I asked him directly who he was referring to, but I was never given an answer. <b>Fabrizio Rizza</b>, two months before I went back to Abruzzi, broke with his historical girlfriend for another women living in Milan, who was originally from Pescara and just three weeks before this fact they came on holiday in Pescara. At the end of that summer Rizza went back again with his historical girlfriend, sincerely behaving in this way made him the number one suspect besides Mr. Marocchi, but unluckily the brain of the judge didn't see any crime.</b></li>
<li>Among my circle of friends I discovered that at least six of them were also orphans.</li>
<li>I do not even know why the person whom I believed to be "trusted" friends turned against me without any reason (apart from the potential envy, I still wonder if some of them could be also incognito non-heterosexuals) or what my former close friend of family did with the picture he made me take, I'll still have the doubt he did it for some ignoble purpose which could have endangered me or my family (I noticed that my mother from time to time was very concerned in particular with our sister-in-law without any apparent reason and a couple of times I would even say frightened, but she always denied everything when I asked). Sometimes I even feared that I or my family have become the target of a criminal or human trafficking organization for other reason I do not want to tell. Anyway I filed a complaint against all them, but it was dismissed (as a curious note the judicial police who managed the complaint had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancuso_%27ndrina">another notorious calabrese surname Mancuso</a> and news about unprincipled lawyers do exist).</li>
<li><p>In 2023 I relocated near the city of <b>Varese</b> close to the border between Italy and Switzerland under the advice of <b>Alfredo Paolillo</b> (a former alumni of my university though a close friend of Rizza) in order to get a better salary <a href="https://fededim.github.io/working_switzerland_cross_border.html">(see my other page about working in Switzerland as cross-border worker)</a> with the aim of starting a lawsuit against Genova's courthouse for the slanderous management of my initial lawsuit. But I would say I fell from the frying pan into the fire, I was unwelcomed and defamed also here for no reason. As a matter-of-fact I discovered that <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/society/switzerland-has-highest-proportion-of-people-not-identifying-as-male-or-female/48563610#:~:text=Out%20of%2030%20countries%2C%20Switzerland,a%20new%20survey%20has%20found.&text=In%20terms%20of%20all%20LGBT%2B,survey%20by%20Ipsos%20polling%20institute.">Switzerland is one of the countries with the highest proportion of declared LBGT population (around 13%)</a> (and also the close bordering italian cities), in particular in some of the companies where I have worked there was a fair share of non-heterosexual white-collars (as a curious fact one of these companies provides consultants to the Swiss company where Alfredo Paolillo was working as a Program Manager and also some co-workers worked for Accenture in Milan, where one of the brothers of Rizza worked for some years after going back to Zurich). I had been in the past a salsa dancer and I started again going dancing in the half of 2024 in one of the biggest clubs in Milan, the Zoo club, but also there I was mistreated.</p><p>For sure LBGT community has it in for me and I have no clue why except that maybe some of my former acquaintances were not heterosexuals and had it in for me (I underline I have never and I'll never go with anyone else than natural women) or for the sake of argument they joined to defend one of those I sued because I am a heterosexual who started a lawsuit against some suspected non-heterosexuals.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In any case leaving my personal misadventure apart the advices I would like to give to those applying for internation organization are:
<ul>
<li><b>Do not talk with anyone else except your family that you are applying such positions</b>: you never know your friends or with whom they can be related. As a matter-of-fact, the detectives told me once that often the fathers of future brides ask for background checks on the to-be husbands and sometimes they even find something unwelcome which make the marriage to be cancelled.</li>
<li><b>Do not trust any new acquaintances or friends that you knew or got introduced after starting to apply for such positions</b></li>
<li><b>Remember that performing better than others creates for sure envy in some of your acquaintances and envy creates silent enemies, sometimes even deadly.</b></li>
</ul>
