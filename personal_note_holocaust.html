        <p><img src="./Images/Federico_Di_Marco_2024_Varese.jpg" alt="Federico Di Marco" title="Federico Di Marco" class="center"></p>

        <p>I’m a senior software engineer, born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa"><b>Genova, Italy</b></a>, with a master degree in computer science, in the second half of his forties.</p>
        <p>I started using a computer at six years old, went through logo, basic, assembly, C/C++, java and finally to .NET and .NET core. Proficient also in databases, especially Sql Server and reporting. Let’s say I also have some experience in security but mainly in the past, now things have become much more difficult and I do not have too much time to keep myself updated, but sometimes I am still kicking in.</p>
        <p>I am a fan of videogames, technologies, motorbikes, travelling and comedy (click my name above for my main page).</p>

        <p>Famous quotes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>"No one can imagine how cruel an entire country comes to be when it targets someone, making up stories, going so far as to slander, trampling on the most basic rules of civilized living." (<a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaetano_Afeltra">Gaetano Afeltra, an italian journalist and writer</a>).</b></li>
			<li><b>"There will never be democracy or justice as long as anyone, using the discretionary power of doctors and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_theory_of_truth"><b>fallacious consensus theory of truth</b></a>, the main instruments of repression of Western societies which define themselves as civil, is used to dismiss a lawsuit and to aid and abet criminals." (Federico Di Marco)</b></li>

        <h2 id="personalnote">Personal note on Holocaust</h2>

        <p>The 27th January of every year honours the memorial of the Nazi Holocaust where it is estimated that around six million of Jewish people and other seven million of non-Jewish people were exterminated in death camps. Hitler was for sure one the main responsibles for this genocide (though in history the communism with the <a href="https://whatculture.com/offbeat/8-world-leaders-with-the-highest-death-tolls?page=7">Russian Stalin</a> and the <a href="https://whatculture.com/offbeat/8-world-leaders-with-the-highest-death-tolls?page=9">Chinese Mao</a> did worse killing respectively around 40 and 75 millions of people), but there is always an underrated person who was directly involved in the killings at death camps, the psychopath German doctor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Mengele">Josef Mengele</a>.<br /> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Josef_Mengele%2C_Auschwitz._Album_H%C3%B6cker_%28cropped%29.jpg" alt="Josef Mendele picture" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 30%;">.</p>
        <p>
            He was one of the "team of doctors" who selected the victims to be murdered (including women, children and elderly) in the gas chamber and he was also one of those who administered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zyklon_B">deadly gas Zyklon B</a>.
            His mind was interested in studying identical twins, people with different eyes colour, dwarfs and people with physical abnormalities; he was nicknamed the <b>"Angel of Death"</b> since he performed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_human_experimentation">deadly experiments on prisoners</a> like:
            <ul>
                <li>amputating healthy limbs</li>
                <li>deliberately infecting them with diseases such as typhus, tetanus, malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, yellow fever, hepatitis, Streptococcus or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_perfringens">Clostridium perfringens</a> (a major causative agent in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_gangrene">gas gangrene</a>)</li>
                <li>transfusing the blood of one into another</li>
                <li>sewing twins together to create conjoined twins</li>
                <li>injecting chemicals into inmates' eyes to change their eye colour</li>
                <li>performing lethal injections</li>
                <li>poisoning the food given to prisoners</li>
                <li>performing prisoners to electroshock therapy</li>
                <li>removing the eyes of dead inmates and occasionally "pinning them on walls like butterflies"</li>
                <li>killing prisoners by placing them naked in the open air or in freezing water for several hours with temperature as low as -6C (21F)</li>
                <li>killing prisoners by placing them for long in a low-pressure chamber in to simulate conditions at high-altitude</li>
                <li>killing prisoners by feeding them with only salted or filtered seawater</li>
                <li>sterilizing women by injecting caustic substances into their uteruses without anaesthetics or using x-rays.</li>
                <li>informing in advance women about the date of their death in order to evaluate how their psychological distress would affect their menstruation cycles.</li>
                <li>undergoing unnecessary drug and X-ray treatments</li>
                <li>removing the bones, muscles and nerves, hearts and stomachs of victims without anaesthesia</li>
                <li>forcing inmates who survived the removal of a kidney to work without painkillers afterwards</li>
                <li>attempting to attach the urinary tract of a 7-year-old girl to her own colon.</li>
                <li>performing head injury experiments on a young boy of twelve by strapping him to a chair so that he could not move and hitting his head with a mechanized hammer every few seconds. The boy was driven insane from such a torture.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>He showed no mercy for the victims' health, safety, or physical and emotional suffering (he was capable of being so kind to the children, to have them become fond of him, to bring them sugar, and then, next to that he was going to send them to die by the crematoria smoke). Re-reading all kind of experiments he performed on human beings (or better say human guinea pigs) perhaps it was to be hoped to die immediately in the gas chambers upon arrival at the concentration camp or even directly in the battlefield.</p>

        <p><b>Personally, he was the greatest psychopath and criminal mind in the whole history, incomparable to any serial killer in the world. <u>And what is even more astonishing is the fact that governments after the Second World War gave to those who practise his same profession (e.g. doctors) the ability to arbitrarily decide whether someone is sane or not</u>.</b></p>
