<p>I’m a senior software engineer, born in Genova, Italy, with a master degree in computer science, in the second half of his forties.</p>
<p>Started using a computer at six years, gone through logo, basic, assembly, C/C++, java and finally to .NET and .NET core. Proficient also in databases, especially Sql Server and reporting. Let’s say I have also some experience on security but mainly in the past, now things have become much more difficult and I do not have too much time to keep me updated, but sometimes I am still kicking in.</p>
<p>Fan of videogames, technologies, motorbikes, travelling and comedy.</p>

<p>Famous quotes:

<li><b>"No one can imagine how cruel an entire country comes to be when it targets someone, making up stories, going so far as to slander, trampling on the most basic rules of civilized living."

<p>I am an owner of a Golf MK7.5 and I have written some detailed guides for a few optionals I retrofitted on my car, you can find them here:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/camera-calibration.html">Camera Calibration</a>: it is the process of determining both extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters (like camera coordinates, focal length, optical center) once installed. It is a <b>mandatory process</b> needed to perform any kind of calculation on an image, like measuring a distance between pixels, estimate depth or 3d structure. It is performed using a predefined <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/calibration-patterns.html">calibration pattern</a> consisting of a sheet where a set of objects of a predetermined shape (like squares, circles), size and position is put in front of the camera at a precise distance.<p>Every camera manufacturer has its own calibration pattern; for Volkswagen it is called <a href="https://it.aliexpress.com/item/1005006292986980.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.56923696TD0njL&gatewayAdapt=glo2ita">VAS 6430</a>. Usually you have to perform calibration at carglass centers where they have all the needed equipment, but if you are skilled enough and you know what you are doing you can perform it by yourself using either official VW ODIS (guided procedure) or OBD11, I quote here an untested OBD11 procedure which I found on a Skoda owner website:
<ul>
<li>Position the car in front of the calibration pattern as in this <a href="./Images/Golf calibration.png">picture</a></li>
<li><b>Measure 4 wheel arches</b> and go to module <b>A5 Front Sensors Driver Assistance System</b> performing the security access with code 20103</li>
<li>Change diagnostic service --> VW</li>
<li>Go to Adaptation (confirm all values!)
<ul>
<li>Body height wheel house edge-Body height left front wheel house edge --> Enter value</li>
<li>Body height wheel house edge-Body height right front wheel house edge --> Enter value</li>
<li>Body height wheel house edge-Body height left rear wheel house edge --> Enter value​</li>
<li>Body height wheel house edge-Body height right rear wheel house edge --> Enter value</li> 
<li>Distance to calibration field --> Enter 1500</li>
<li>Calibration target position --> Just confirm</li>
<li>Axel offset --> Just confirm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to Basic Configuration
<ul>
<li>Search calibration target</li>
<li>Initial online configuration</li>
<li>Static calibration costumer service</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change diagnostic service --> End of assembly line</li>
<li>Basic Configuration --> Static calibration end of assembly line</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If everything is fine the fault about "No basic settings" should be removed and this marks the end of the <b>static</b> calibration (called static because the car is not moving). Since this calibration is never perfect the lane assist camera A5 after this phase enters another calibration phase called <b>dynamic</b> because it is performed automatically by the camera while you drive (you have to drive for at least 500 kms), the more you drive, the better the calibration will be fine-tuned, you can check this in the Live Data menu option (Dynamic calibration, status and Dynamic calibration, details).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="retrofits">VW Odis software</h2>
Just some information about the VW Odis software, there are two versions:
<ul>
<li><b>Odis Service</b>: it works only online and you need a login/password called GeKo access (price around 30$ an hour on internet, more convenient for increasing durations, you can also buy it directly at <a href="https://volkswagen.erwin-store.com/erwin/showHome.do">Volkswagen ErWin</a>, but it costs more). You must use this for:
<ul>
<li>Removing component protection on specific control units (adaptive cruise control, gateway, dashboard, engine, gear, multimedia unit, gps by the way lane assist, heated windscreen and blind spot assist DO NOT USE component protection)</li>
<li>Replacing the ignition key (e.g. activating immobilizer on a new key)</li>
<li>Restore the original coding, adaptations and SWAP codes (SWAP = SoftWare As Product, some optionals are already built-in but disabled and they are activated through SWAP codes like voice commands, travel assist, emergency assist, etc.). There are even other codes, called SVM codes, which allow you to add officially retrofits to your car (and perform coding and adaptations automatically for them), but you have to buy them from VW or authorised resellers (the configuration of the optionals of your car is linked to the VIN and it is stored on VW servers).</li>
<li>Perform software updates according to campaigns (on every campaign document there should be a code provided which must be entered in Odis Service to perform the upgrade)</li>
<li>Fixing severe errors which are not solvable with the other Odis (Engineering, see below)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Odis Engineering</b>: it works only offline and it allows you
<ul>
<li>Perform coding and adaptations (like OBD11)</li>
<li>Performing backup/restore of coding/adaptations (like OBD11)</li>
<li>Check faults (it provides better details on errors than OBD11)</li>
<li>Flashing control units, e.g. updating/downgrading firmware</li>
<li>Data transfer, e.g. writing xml parameter data on control units: this is the specific data of the car model (Golf, Passat, T-Roc, Tiguan, usually control units firmware is shared between different car models of the same manufacturer) and of the installed optionals (e.g. the adaptive cruise control could also work the car navigation data to give you also predictive cruise control, etc.) which must be uploaded to the control units usually after a new firmware upgrade / retrofit installation (even though sometimes new firmwares of some control units still use the old parameter data).</li>
<li>Perform offline guided functions like calibration, basic settings, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Both software work with the interface <a href="https://www.vncishop.com/wholesale/vnci-6154a-and-usb-software.html">VNCI 6154</a>, you can download a VMware virtual machine from forums on internet with everything installed (it is very time consuming to install by yourself), if you are lazy you can pay something more (around 10$) when ordering VNCI 6154 and you will receive an USB key with the software.
