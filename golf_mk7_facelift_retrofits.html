<p>I’m a senior software engineer, born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa">Genova, Italy</a>, with a master degree in computer science, in the second half of his forties.</p>
<p>I started using a computer at six years old, went through logo, basic, assembly, C/C++, java and finally to .NET and .NET core. Proficient also in databases, especially Sql Server and reporting. Let’s say I also have some experience in security but mainly in the past, now things have become much more difficult and I do not have too much time to keep myself updated, but sometimes I am still kicking in.</p>
<p>I am a fan of videogames, technologies, motorbikes, travelling and comedy (click my name above for my main page).</p>

<p>Famous quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>"No one can imagine how cruel an entire country comes to be when it targets someone, making up stories, going so far as to slander, trampling on the most basic rules of civilized living." (<a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaetano_Afeltra">Gaetano Afeltra, an italian journalist and writer</a>).</b></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hwinterfaces">VW Group hardware interfaces for retrofits</h2>
<p>For performing retrofits you must have a hardware OBD II interface in order to configure the new optionals which you have retrofitted inside your car control units. The hardware OBDII interfaces which I use are (they both support all VW group car, so <b>VW, Seat, Skoda, Audi, etc.</b>):</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://www.vncishop.com/wholesale/vnci-6154a-and-usb-software.html">VNCI 6154</a></b>: <u>this is best unofficial chinese clone of the original Volkswagen 6154 interface and it supports all its functions for a bargain price (around <b>130$</b>)</u>. It works with both the official Volkswagen software <b>Odis Service</b> and <b>Odis Engineering</b> which require a laptop/computer (<a href="#odissoftware">see here</a> for details) and it supports both cable and wireless connection. This is a must have for performing any retrofits.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://obdeleven.com?aff=4308&utm_source=afltly&utm_medium=affiliate">OBDeleven</a></b>: this OBD11 dongle includes a very usable modern mobile app <b>for the quick configuration and tweaking of your car</b>.  but it less powerful than the combination of VNCI 6154A + ODIS (there are functions which it can't perform like flashing, writing datasets, etc.). <u>So this interface is optional (you can do everything with VNCI 6154), but it is wireless, very small to keep in your car (I always leave it connected to the OBD II port of my car) and it is very handy due to their mobile app. Moreover you can check any faults anywhere you are or read live data while driving using its mobile app</u>. Price <b>100$</b>.<br/><br/>Note: I bought it in 2019 the second version and it was sold as a product (so you paid only once and luckily it is still like this today for me), unluckily <b>the greedy, ruthless mind of businesses following the modern fad (e.g the transformation of products into services) turned it into a service requiring you to pay an annual subscription becoming now much more expensive. So if you are private like me (e.g. you do not perform retrofits as work and you use it occasionally) OBD11 is less appealing than VNCI 6154 though much more user friendly for the common features</b> (personally it would have been wiser to make you pay according to the number of times you actually use it).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="retrofits">Golf MK7 Facelift retrofits guides</h2>

<p>I am an owner of a Golf MK7.5 and I have written some detailed guides for a few optionals I retrofitted on my car, you can find them here:</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="./Retrofits/Golf_MK7.5/Blind%20Spot%20Assist/Volkswagen%20Golf%20MK7.5%20Facelift%20Blind%20Spot%20Assist%20Retrofit.pdf">Volkswagen Golf MK7.5 Facelift Blind Spot Assist Retrofit guide</a></b>:

<li><b><a href="./Retrofits/Golf_MK7.5/Lane%20Assist/Volkswagen%20Golf%20MK7.5%20Facelift%20Lane%20Assist%20Retrofit%20V1.1.pdf">Volkswagen Golf MK7.5 Facelift Lane Assist Retrofit guide</a></b>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2hk7vTIvNM">General overview video</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucE7aRJweYU">Extended test video on the highway</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Mr-MIBonk/Lane-Assistant-60-Seconds">Firmware and associated parameter files with warning time increased from 15 seconds to 60</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/camera-calibration.html">Camera Calibration</a>: it is the process of determining both extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters (like camera coordinates, focal length, optical center) once installed. It is a <b>mandatory process</b> needed to perform any kind of calculation on an image, like measuring a distance between pixels, estimate depth or 3d structure. It is performed using a predefined <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/calibration-patterns.html">calibration pattern</a> consisting of a sheet where a set of objects of a predetermined shape (like squares, circles), size and position is put in front of the camera at a precise distance.<p>Every camera manufacturer has its own calibration pattern; for Volkswagen it is called <a href="https://it.aliexpress.com/item/1005006292986980.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.56923696TD0njL&gatewayAdapt=glo2ita">VAS 6430</a>. Usually you have to perform calibration at carglass centers where they have all the needed equipment, but if you are skilled enough and you know what you are doing you can perform it by yourself using either official VW ODIS (guided procedure) or OBD11, I quote here an untested OBD11 procedure which I found on a Skoda owner website:
<ul>
<li>Position the car in front of the calibration pattern as in this <a href="./Images/Golf_calibration.png">picture</a></li>
<li><b>Measure 4 wheel arches</b> and go to module <b>A5 Front Sensors Driver Assistance System</b> performing the security access with code 20103</li>
<li>Change diagnostic service --> VW</li>
<li>Go to Adaptation (confirm all values!)
<ul>
<li>Body height wheel house edge-Body height left front wheel house edge --> Enter value</li>
<li>Body height wheel house edge-Body height right front wheel house edge --> Enter value</li>
<li>Body height wheel house edge-Body height left rear wheel house edge --> Enter value</li>
<li>Body height wheel house edge-Body height right rear wheel house edge --> Enter value</li> 
<li>Distance to calibration field --> Enter 1500</li>
<li>Calibration target position --> Just confirm</li>
<li>Axel offset --> Just confirm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to Basic Configuration
<ul>
<li>Search calibration target</li>
<li>Initial online configuration</li>
<li>Static calibration costumer service</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change diagnostic service --> End of assembly line</li>
<li>Basic Configuration --> Static calibration end of assembly line</li>
</ul>
<p>If everything is fine the fault about "No basic settings" should be removed and this marks the end of the <b>static</b> calibration (called static because the car is not moving). Since this calibration is never perfect the lane assist camera A5 after this phase enters another calibration phase called <b>dynamic</b> because it is performed automatically by the camera while you drive (you have to drive for at least 500 kms), the more you drive, the better the calibration will be fine-tuned, you can check this in the Live Data menu option (Dynamic calibration, status and Dynamic calibration, details).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Volkswagen Golf MK7.5 Facelift Park Steering Assist 3.0 Retrofit guide</b>: I still need to write the guide (as far as I know there isn't any available), I have though made all the necessary pictures during the retrofit, I just need some time to draft it. Sample videos here:
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Volkswagen Golf MK7.5 Facelift PXC dynamic light assist</b>: I bought used <b>5G194108xB GTE headlights</b> the ones with lower blue "whiskers" and this was an easier retrofit for me because the car had PXA headlights from factory so it was just a matter of replacing them and adding a single wire for each one using T shaped wire tap. What "drove me crazy" was instead buying a used set of working headlights (I had to send them back two times) and then to setup the right codings which I quote down below. Sample videos here:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/aKzEsl--tu4">Golf MK7 Facelift retrofitted the blue Golf GTE PXC headlights (very cool on white painted car)</a></li>

<br/>
<b>Volkswagen Golf MK7.5 Facelift full Odis backup</b>: <u>my car had adaptive cruise control, PXA led lights, front and rear park assist sensors and Discover Media navigator from factory</u>, I retrofitted successfully:
<ul>
<li><b>the heated windscreen</b></li>
<li><b>the lane assist camera+traffic sign recognition+high beam assist (initially)</b></li>
<li><b>blind spot assist with the new 2Q090768x control units supporting emergency maneuver braking</b>: in order to support maneuver braking I had also to update the firmware of the 03 ABS control unit, <u>be sure to perform a backup of the 03 control unit with Odis before doing this otherwise you would get a dead car!</u></li>
<li><b>the park steering assist 3.0 for automatic parking</b></li>
<li><b>the PXC dynamic light assist using Golf MK7 Facelift GTE headlights with "whiskers" in blue colour</b></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="odissoftware">VW Odis software</h2>
Just some information about the VW Odis software, there are two versions:
<ul>
<li><b>Odis Service</b>: it works only online and you need a login/password called GeKo access (price around 30$-40$ an hour on internet, more convenient for increasing durations, you can also buy it directly at <a href="https://volkswagen.erwin-store.com/erwin/showHome.do">Volkswagen ErWin</a>, but it costs more). You must use this for:
<ul>
<li>Removing component protection on specific control units (adaptive cruise control, gateway, dashboard, engine, gear, multimedia unit, gps by the way lane assist, heated windscreen and blind spot assist DO NOT USE component protection in a Golf MK7)</li>
<li>Replacing the ignition key (e.g. activating immobilizer on a new key)</li>
<li>Restore the original coding, adaptations and SWAP codes (SWAP = SoftWare As Product, some optionals are already built-in but disabled and they are activated through SWAP codes like voice commands, travel assist, emergency assist, etc.). There are even other codes, called <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/tsbs/2019/MC-10166284-9999.pdf">SVM codes</a>, which allow you to add officially retrofits to your car (and perform coding and adaptations automatically for them), but you have to buy them from VW or authorised resellers (the configuration of the optionals of your car is linked to the VIN and it is stored on VW servers).</li>
<li>Perform software updates according to campaigns (on every campaign document there should be a code provided which must be entered in Odis Service to perform the upgrade)</li>
<li>Fixing severe errors which are not solvable with the other Odis (Engineering, see below)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Odis Engineering</b>: it works only offline and it allows you
<ul>
<li>Perform coding and adaptations (like OBD11)</li>
<li>Performing backup/restore of coding/adaptations (like OBD11)</li>
<li>Check faults (like OBD11 though it provides better details on errors)</li>
<li>Flashing control units, e.g. updating/downgrading firmware</li>
<li>Data transfer, e.g. writing xml parameter data on control units: this is the specific data of the car model (Golf, Passat, T-Roc, Tiguan, usually control units firmware is shared between different car models of the same manufacturer) and of the installed optionals (e.g. the adaptive cruise control could also work the car navigation data to give you also predictive cruise control, etc.) which must be uploaded to the control units usually after a new firmware upgrade / retrofit installation (even though sometimes new firmwares of some control units still use the old parameter data).</li>
<li>Perform offline guided functions like calibration, basic settings, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Both software work with the interface <a href="https://www.vncishop.com/wholesale/vnci-6154a-and-usb-software.html">VNCI 6154</a>, you can download a VMware virtual machine from forums on internet with everything installed (it is very time consuming to install by yourself), if you are lazy you can pay something more (around 10$) when ordering VNCI 6154 and you will receive an USB key with the software.
