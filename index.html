<p>I’m a senior software engineer, born in Genova, Italy, with a master degree in computer science, in the second half of his forties.</p>
<p>Started using a computer at six years, gone through logo, basic, assembly, C/C++, java and finally to .NET and .NET core. Proficient also in databases, especially Sql Server and reporting. Let’s say I have also some experience on security but mainly in the past, now things have become much more difficult and I do not have too much time to keep me updated, but sometimes I am still kicking in.</p>
<p>Fan of videogames, technologies, motorbikes, travelling and comedy.</p>

<b>Shooting</b>: for a very small part of my life I trained at dynamic shooting with a Glock 17 calibre 9mm and I obtained a Bronze certificate. I was very quick at shooting "looking like a hitman" and I was made a video, however I can't find it anymore. I am not an expert with guns and I choose a Glock due to the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Hard">Die Hard</a> movie, where the main actor Bruce Willis talked about the Glock, a gun stated there to be made up porcelain whereas it is actually made partially with a polymer giving it the lightness as main characteristic.

Fow now I have flown with a DJI Mini 3 PRO which paradoxically wouldn't require any license, however for the law if you fly in a red zone or you have an incident with the UAS (e.g. collision with an obstacle) without reporting it to the national italian flight agency (ENAC) within 72 hours you are prosecutable.

<p>I am an owner of a Golf MK7.5 and I have written some detailed guides for a few optionals I retrofitted, you can find them here:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/camera-calibration.html">Calibration</a>: it is the process of determining both extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters (like camera coordinates, focal length, optical center) once installed. It is a <b>mandatory process</b> needed to perform any kind of calculation on an image, like measuring a distance between pixels, estimate depth or 3d structure. It is performed using a predefined <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/calibration-patterns.html">calibration pattern</a> consisting of a sheet where a set of objects of a predetermined shape (like squares, circles), size and position is put in front of the camera at a precise distance.<p>Every camera manufacturer has its own calibration pattern; for Volkswagen it is called <a href="https://it.aliexpress.com/item/1005006292986980.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.56923696TD0njL&gatewayAdapt=glo2ita">VAS 6430</a>. Usually you have to perform calibration at carglass centers where they have all the needed equipment, but if you are skilled enough and you know what you are doing you can perform it by yourself using either official VW ODIS (guided procedure) or OBD11, I quote here an untested OBD11 procedure which I found on a Skoda owner website:
<ul>
<li>Position the car in front of the calibration pattern as in this <a href="./Images/Golf calibration.png">picture</a></li>
<li><b>Measure 4 wheel arches</b> and go to module <b>A5 Front Sensors Driver Assistance System</b> performing the security access with code 20103</li>
<li>Change diagnostic service --> VW</li>
<li>Go to Adaptation (confirm all values!)
<ul>
<li>Body height wheel house edge-Body height left front wheel house edge --> Enter value</li>
<li>Body height wheel house edge-Body height right front wheel house edge --> Enter value</li>
<li>Body height wheel house edge-Body height left rear wheel house edge --> Enter value​</li>
<li>Body height wheel house edge-Body height right rear wheel house edge --> Enter value</li> 
<li>Distance to calibration field --> Enter 1500</li>
<li>Calibration target position --> Just confirm</li>
<li>Axel offset --> Just confirm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to Basic Configuration
<ul>
<li>Search calibration target</li>
<li>Initial online configuration</li>
<li>Static calibration costumer service</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change diagnostic service --> End of assembly line</li>
<li>Basic Configuration --> Static calibration end of assembly line</li>
</ul>
</p>
<ul></ul>
</li>
If everything is fine the fault about "No basic settings" should be removed and this marks the end of the <b>static</b> calibration (called static because the car is not moving). Since this calibration is never perfect the lane assist camera A5 after this phase enters another calibration phase called <b>dynamic</b> because it is performed automatically by the camera while you drive (you have to drive for at least 500 kms), the more you drive, the better the calibration will be fine-tuned, you can check this in the Live Data menu option (Dynamic calibration, status and Dynamic calibration, details).
</ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></li>

<br/>
<br/>Here you can find good-res pictures (sorry taken using a mobile) of PCB of blind spot assist radar <b>5QD907685 rev. H12</b>: (<a href="./Retrofits/Golf_MK7.5/Blind%20Spot%20Assist/5QD907685_H12_Front_1.jpg">Front 1</a>&nbsp;<a href="./Retrofits/Golf_MK7.5/Blind%20Spot%20Assist/5QD907685_H12_Front_2.jpg">Front 2</a>&nbsp;<a href="./Retrofits/Golf_MK7.5/Blind%20Spot%20Assist/5QD907685_H12_Back_1.jpg">Back 1</a>) which I disassembled in order to update the firmware of the slave (left) control unit, unluckily I was unable to find on this hardware revision any eeprom chip (it is integrated in the BGA SOC) and also even a serial header (when I have some time I'll try to desolder the SOC and track the path on the PCB to identify the UART pins or if I bother I'll buy two new control units).</li>

<p>This is the part list I was able to identify (I am not an electronic engineer though I know a little bit of digital electronics): <br/><br/>

<li><b><a href="https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html">Ventoy</a></b>: a must have for any it engineer or enthusiast, its motto can be summed up in <b>"One USB key to rule them all"</b>. This tool allows you to create a bootable usb drive supporting multiple iso images in just one partition. Essentially you create only one single big partition on your USB drive where you install initially Ventoy and then you copy one or more iso images (several formats supported) as standard filesystem files. When Ventoy boots it will ask through a simple menu which iso image you want to mount and boot.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://www.statuscake.com/">StatusCake</a></b>: it is a fully featured website monitoring tool. It has a free tier supporting https and free notifications to one or more Telegram users.</li>

<li><b><a href="https://www.vncishop.com/">VNCI SHOP</a></b>: it is the online official shop for VNCI interfaces, the cheapest and most featured OBD-II interfaces for retrofitting and tweaking your car (almost all brands). For VW group you can buy the <a href="https://www.vncishop.com/wholesale/vnci-6154a-diagnostic-tool.html">VNCI 6154A</a> which is fully backwards compatible with the original Volkswagen VAS 6154A interface and ODIS software at a bargain price!</li>
<li><b><a href="https://obdeleven.com/">OBDeleven</a></b>: it is a very usable mobile app with its own OBD-II dongle for coding and retrofits for VW group and other brands vehicles (though less powerful than the combination of VNCI 6154A + ODIS).</li>
<li><b><a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a></b>: it is a free, open source, multi-platform DLNA media server (based on .NET core!) which allows you to stream your local media (audio, video or pictures) to your home network performing transcoding when needed. It is the only free I found supporting hardware transcoding (it uses FFmpeg underneath).</li>
