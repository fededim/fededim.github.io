<p>I’m a senior software engineer, born in Genova, Italy, with a master degree in computer science, in the second half of his forties.</p>
<p>Started using a computer at six years, gone through logo, basic, assembly, C/C++, java and finally to .NET and .NET core. Proficient also in databases, especially Sql Server and reporting. Let’s say I have also some experience on security but mainly in the past, now things have become much more difficult and I do not have too much time to keep me updated, but sometimes I am still kicking in.</p>
<p>Fan of videogames, technologies, motorbikes, travelling and comedy.</p>

<b>Shooting</b>: for a very small part of my life I trained at dynamic shooting with a Glock 17 calibre 9mm and I obtained a Bronze certificate. I was very quick at shooting "looking like a hitman" and I was made a video, however I can't find it anymore. I am not an expert with guns and I choose a Glock due to the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Hard">Die Hard</a> movie, where the main actor Bruce Willis talked about the Glock, a gun stated there to be made up porcelain whereas it is actually made partially with a polymer giving it the lightness as main characteristic.

<b>UAS (drones)</b>: I have achieved both <a href="https://fededim.github.io/Certificates/Various/UAS%20A1-A3%20certificate.pdf">A1/A3</a> and <a href="https://fededim.github.io/Certificates/Various/UAE%20A2%20certificate.pdf">A2</a> certificates for operating drones, only in open categories. Fow now I have flown with a DJI Mini 3 PRO which paradoxically wouldn't require any license, however for the law if you fly in a red zone or you have an incident with the UAS (e.g. collision with an obstacle) without reporting it to the national italian flight agency (ENAC) within 72 hours you are prosecutable.

<li><b><a href="https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html">Ventoy</a></b>: a must have for any it engineer or enthusiast, its motto can be summed up in <b>"One USB key to rule them all"</b>. This tool allows you to create a bootable usb drive supporting multiple iso images in just one partition. Essentially you create only one single big partition on your USB drive where you install initially Ventoy and then you copy one or more iso images (several formats supported) as standard filesystem files. When Ventoy boots it will ask through a simple menu which iso image you want to mount and boot.</li>

<li><b><a href="https://www.vncishop.com/">VNCI SHOP</a></b>: it is the online official shop for VNCI interfaces, the cheapest and most featured OBD-II interfaces for retrofitting and tweaking your car (almost all brands). For VW group you can buy the <a href="https://www.vncishop.com/wholesale/vnci-6154a-diagnostic-tool.html">VNCI 6154A</a> which is fully backwards compatible with the original Volkswagen VAS 6154A interface and ODIS software at a bargain price!</li>
<li><b><a href="https://obdeleven.com/">OBDeleven</a></b>: it is a very usable mobile app with its own OBD-II dongle for coding and retrofits for VW group and other brands vehicles (though less powerful than the combination of VNCI 6154A + ODIS).</li>
<li><b><a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a></b>: it is a free, open source, multi-platform DLNA media server (based on .NET core!) which allows you to stream your local media (audio, video or pictures) to your home network performing transcoding when needed. It is the only free I found supporting hardware transcoding (it uses FFmpeg underneath).</li>
<li><b><a href="https://github.com/LTRData/ImDisk">ImDisk Toolkit</a></b>: it is a free virtual disk driver to mount iso images on Windows, but it allows you also to create one or more ram disk drives. A ram disk drive was native on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga">Amiga</a>, a leading eighties’ home computer now almost dead; I use this tool mainly to allow Jellyfin to store temporary transcoding files in RAM without wearing my SSD TBW (terabytes written).</li>

<h2 id="personalnote">Personal note</h2>

<p>I have always been a heterosexual and I have always tolerated and respected non heterosexual persons, probably due to my limited involvement with them. Around ten years ago a former Calabrian former friend of mine introduced me a m***n with a criminal record and non-heterosexual tendencies who tried to involve me into a scam and I literally sent to fuck him off reporting him also to authorities. The judge insanely decided not to proceed with lawsuit and later I was started unbelievably being defamed by other person associated with Calabrians and LBGT community.</p>
Since then, I was stamped as a "crazy" and an anti-LBGT person due to my jokes and my consideration that sometimes they react in the same way as criminal associations. As a matter of fact I stumbled upon this <a href="https://thatparkplace.com/soulash-2-developer-refuses-to-cater-to-lgbtq-mob-trying-to-cancel-the-game-theres-nothing-to-fear-from-the-oppressive-mob-trying-to-force-their-ideology/">recent news</a> on a Soulash 2, an indie developed game (so done usually by a single developer or a very small group of persons), which was review bombed for the decision of the creator of not allowing same sex marriages.</p>
<p>I do not know why an association of persons should be allowed to put down a single person or a very small group, sincerely this is the well-known behaviour of criminal associations - the <b>"mud machine"</b> see <a href="https://evangelicalfocus.com/culture-making/3961/mud-machine">here</a> and also <a href="https://www-repubblica-it.translate.goog/politica/2011/04/12/news/saviano_fango-14820535/?_x_tr_sl=it&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=it&_x_tr_pto=wapp">the English translation of the original Italian article by Roberto Saviano (the author of Gomorra book) on Repubblica newspaper</a> - (I'm Italian and unluckily mob is a notorious matter connected with my country) which should be blocked and punished according to the law, but it seems that to judges such behaviour is perfectly lawful. The indie developer even reacted in a funny way by saying <b>" After all, it looks like there was nothing to fear from the oppressive mob."</b> and luckily in the end he managed to recover from the initial damage.</p>

<p>But all that happened during my bad experience and its troublesome consequences made me to be more cautious when dealing with LBGT persons, especially in situations where you are "forced" to liaise with them (e.g. at work). The main insights on them I can pass on are:
<ul>
<li><b><i>They are a worldwide association whose member vowed to help themselves everywhere in the world</i></b>: this means that if <u>a non-heterosexual person is mad at you, a lot of them will support him, even if he is wrong or you move to hundreds of miles away</u>. <b>Essentially, they are a dense association, almost ubiquitous.</b></li>
<li><b><i>They are a partially secret (historically secret societies of non-heterosexuals have existed, e.g. see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Chaeronea">Order of Chaeronea</a>) </i></b>: you do not know who they are, because several of them hide their "membership" by living a normal life, so <u>it could happen that a trustful friend or an acquaintance takes a stand against you without any apparent reason</u> (e.g. <b>it is difficult sometimes to spot them</b>)</li>
<li><b><i>When they feel in danger or disrespected, they do not hesitate in using "the mud machine" just in the same way as mobster do</i></b>. In your life you can disagree or not like someone, if both persons are balanced, they understand that the world is quite big enough for everyone to live his life without bothering the other, this however is very difficult to let them understand.</li>
<li><b><i>They have a great economic power and they are connected to persons in powerful positions like politicians, judges, law enforcement personnel or doctors</i></b>: fundamentally, <u>they are all "their armed branch" and they will use it against a target if needed.</u></li>
<li><b><i>They are known to be "serial" liars, so they can't be trusted at all</i></b>: there are different papers on internet studying this phenomenon, but what beats everything is that they are unbelievably the first ones stating so in interviews, even <a href="https://www.oggi.it/gossip/amori/2022/05/21/gabriel-garko-cosi-mi-sono-ripreso-la-mia-vita-e-le-donne-mi-saltano-ancora-addosso-esclusivo/">famous Italian actors!</a> They usually use lies to stage their "Latin lover" reputation taking advantage of women both accomplices and non and to live the life they want. The motto of their public events is the word "pride", yet as a matter of fact some of them when they are not attending these events, they live "proudly" a double life. And nevertheless, what takes the biscuit is that women are still attracted to them!</u></li>
<li><b><i>They usually feel envy towards others and envy is also supposed to be one of the main components of same sex attraction</i></b>: you can google for this speculated connection, personally they feel envy because they are a minority compared to heterosexuals and they want to prove that they are as good as them. Well essentially we are all born biologically man and women, so there is no limitation in any of them (excluding obviously people with handicaps), some doctors postulated the existence of non-heterosexual genes, but it has not been proved yet and moreover this conjecture has been confuted by the news that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/lesbian-straight-twins-human-sexuality-understand-orientation-dna-a8090421.html">identical twin with different sexual orientation do exist.</a> There are several articles and studies who suppose that we are all born bisexuals (even the famous "Sigmund Freud" stated this) and during our life we learn our sexual preference (so it is essentially a matter of choice, as further proof think to the fact that sexual preference could also change during life, a former non-heterosexual could become heterosexual or vice versa) . <u>From my standpoint it can be reasonably true - I can't say it is true because I am mathematician so it should be proved formally -, in particular due to the fact that when we "play with ourselves" it is the hand of a same sex person (e.g. ours) producing the sexual arousal.</u> Therefore, everyone can go with everyone:
<ul>
<li><b><i>for the women</b></i> it is far easier to perform a sexual intercourse with anyone they prefer (I do not believe that ALL non-heterosexual women if they are touched by a man they would not get aroused as well as ALL heterosexual women if touched by a woman they wouldn't get excited)</li>
<li><b><i>for the man</b></i> maybe it was more difficult in the past, nowadays thank to the erectile dysfunction drugs they too can go with anyone (again I do not believe that ALL non-heterosexual man if they are touched by a woman they would not get aroused as well as ALL heterosexual men if touched by a man they wouldn't get excited). Otherwise, what is the difference between a man suffering erectile dysfunction and a non-heterosexual ? According to my way of thinking it is just a matter of choice.</u></li>
</ul>
</li>
<br/>
<p>So, summing up so there is no point in feeling envy which IMHO is more a pathological disease (but this is another topic) and who knows maybe in the future a non-heterosexual will become the president of United States as plotted in a Simpson episode.</p>
<p><u>And there is no point in committing crimes using unprincipled doctors, judges and persons of "doubtful virtue" for staging that someone is a non-heterosexual and he does not understand it JUST FOR NOT MAKING LBGT members appear as "stupids" who prefer relationship with same sex persons OR AIDING AND ABETTING a non-heterosexual courthouse collaborator or a criminal association of scammers. If a judge is non-dishonest, he does not allow fake rumours or slander to be spread against an innocent person or family, if he has really suspected on someone, he puts a silent tail on him without allowing his reputation to be damaged. <b>In fact the main characteristic which defines a non-heterosexual person is that he has an intimate relationship with a person of the same sex, no matter anything else</b>.</u><p>
<li><b><i>They often drop subtle hints or even try to convince to experience a same sex relationship (probably for the speculation it could be a choice which unsurprisingly they deny)</i></b>: haven't you ever heard about or met in your life anyone who you believed he was a friend and then out of nowhere he unbelievably suggested or even asked you directly to experience a relationship with a person of your same sex ? I don't wish it on anyone, but it happened three times to me, even by a close friend of my family (and what's worse a close friend of my sister-in-law), adducing the fact that perhaps I would have enjoyed it. I was speechless and since then I do not consider them anymore persons worth of my respect (the former friend of family has now three sons and I would like to know how he would react if someone would tell his sons the same, anyway). If you ask me, behaviours like this (e.g. proselytism) make me think that non-hetosexuals might be a kind of cult or "religion".

<p>I end this personal note with two famous quote from <b>Martin Luther King</b>:
<ul>
<li><b><i>"My freedom ends where yours begin"</i></b>: this should be the fundamental principle in every civil society.</li>
<li><b><i>"Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter."</i></b>: this is not an exact quote from his speeches, but rather <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mlk-our-lives-begin-to-end/">summarized from a sermon he uttered the day in 1965 after "Bloody Sunday"</a>
<ul>
<li><b><i>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right.</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice.</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</i></b></li>
