<p>I’m a senior software engineer, born in Genova, Italy, with a master degree in computer science, in the second half of his forties.</p>
<p>Started using a computer at six years, gone through logo, basic, assembly, C/C++, java and finally to .NET and .NET core. Proficient also in databases, especially Sql Server and reporting. Let’s say I have also some experience on security but mainly in the past, now things have become much more difficult and I do not have too much time to keep me updated, but sometimes I am still kicking in.</p>

<b>Shooting</b>: for a very small part of my life I trained at dynamic shooting with a Glock 17 calibre 9mm and I obtained a Bronze certificate. I was very quick at shooting "looking like a hitman" and I was made a video, however I can't find it anymore. I am not an expert with guns and I choose a Glock due to the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Hard">Die Hard</a> movie, where the main actor Bruce Willis talked about the Glock, a gun stated there to be made up porcelain whereas it is actually made partially with a polymer giving it the lightness as main characteristic.

Fow now I have flied with a DJI Mini 3 PRO which paradoxically wouldn't require any license, however for the law if you have an incident with the UAS (e.g. collision with an obstacle) you have to report it to the national italian flight agency (ENAC) within 72 hours otherwise you could be punishable by law (I do not know if such regulation has changed meanwhile).

<h2 id="personalnote">Personal note</h2>

<p>I have always been a heterosexual and I have always tolerated and respected non heterosexual persons, probably due to my limited involvement with them. Around ten years ago a former Calabrian former friend of mine introduced me a m***n with a criminal record and non-heterosexual tendencies who tried to involve me into a scam and I literally sent to fuck him off reporting him also to authorities. The judge insanely decided not to proceed with lawsuit and later I was started unbelievably being defamed by other person associated with Calabrians and LBGT community.</p>
Since then, I was stamped as a "crazy" and an anti-LBGT person due to my jokes and my consideration that sometimes they react in the same way as a criminal associations. As a matter of fact I stumbled upon this <a href="https://thatparkplace.com/soulash-2-developer-refuses-to-cater-to-lgbtq-mob-trying-to-cancel-the-game-theres-nothing-to-fear-from-the-oppressive-mob-trying-to-force-their-ideology/">recent news</a> on a Soulash 2, an indie developed game (so done usually by a single developer or a very small group of persons), which was review bombed for the decision of the creator of not allowing same sex marriages.</p>
<p>I do not know why an association of persons should be allowed to put down a single person or a very small group, sincerely this is the well-known behaviour of criminal associations (I'm Italian and unluckily mob is a notorious matter connected with my country) which should be blocked and punished according to the law, but it seems that to judges such behaviour is perfectly lawful. The indie developer even reacted in a funny way by saying <b>" After all, it looks like there was nothing to fear from the oppressive mob."</b> and luckily in the end he managed to recover from the initial damage.</p>

<p>But all that happened during my bad experience and its troublesome consequences made me to be more cautious when dealing with LBGT persons, the main insights on them I can pass on are:
<ul>
<li><b><i>They are a worldwide association whose member vowed to help themselves everywhere in the world</i></b>: this means that if <u>a non-heterosexual person is mad at you, a lot of them will support him, even if he is wrong or you move to hundreds of miles away</u>. <b>Essentially, they are a dense association, almost ubiquitous.</b></li>
<li><b><i>They are a partially secret (historically secret societies of non-heterosexuals have existed, e.g. see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Chaeronea">Order of Chaeronea</a>) </i></b>: you do not know who they are, because several of them hide their "membership" by living a normal life, so <u>it could happen that a trustful friend or an acquaintance takes a stand against you without any apparent reason</u> (e.g. <b>it is difficult sometimes to spot them</b>)</li>
<li><b><i>When they feel in danger or disrespected, they do not hesitate in using "the mud machine" just in the same way as mobster do</i></b>. In your life you can disagree or not like someone, if both persons are balanced, they understand that the world is quite big enough for everyone to live his life without bothering the other, this however is very difficult to let them understand. <u>I mention here a famous quote by Martin Luther King which should be respected by everyone in a civil society: "My freedom ends where yours begin"</u></li>
<li><b><i>They have a great economic power and they are connected to persons in powerful positions like judges, law enforcement personnel or doctors</i></b>: fundamentally, <u>they are all "their armed branch" and they will use it against a target if needed.</u></li>
<li><b><i>They are known to be "serial" liars, so they can't be trusted at all</i></b>: there are different papers on internet studying this phenomenon, but what beats everything is that they are unbelievably the first ones stating so in interviews, even <a href="https://www.oggi.it/gossip/amori/2022/05/21/gabriel-garko-cosi-mi-sono-ripreso-la-mia-vita-e-le-donne-mi-saltano-ancora-addosso-esclusivo/">famous Italian actors!</a> They usually use lies to stage their "latin lover" reputation taking advantage of women both accomplices and non and to live the life they want. And nevertheless what takes the biscuit is that women are still attracted to them!</u></li>
</ul>
