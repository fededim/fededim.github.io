Federico Di Marco - My personal pages

![Federico Di Marco](./Images/Federico_Di_Marco.jpg "Federico Di Marco")

I'm a senior software engineer, born in Genova, Italy, with a master degree in computer science, in the second half of his forties. Started using a computer at six years, gone through logo, basic, assembly, C/C++, java and finally to .NET and .NET core. Proficient also in databases, especially Sql Server and reporting. Let's say I have also some experience on security but mainly in the past, now things have become much more difficult and I do not have too much time to keep me updated, but sometimes I am still kicking in. Fan of videogames, technologies, motorbikes, travelling and comedy.
